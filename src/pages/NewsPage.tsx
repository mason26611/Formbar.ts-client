							<b>New Teacher Panel: </b>Your student list is going
							to look a little different. Editting permission
							levels and selecting tags is now clearer and easier
							than before. Many of the settings have been moved to
							a single menu, accesible from the gear icon at the
							top of the page. From the Settings tab, you can now
							fast-edit tags, change your class name, and change
							the class entry code. Sounds now play in the browser
							on student activity.

							<b>Select Feature: </b>Quickly and easily poll
							portions of the class. The "Select" section of the
							panel now auto-fills with all tags students have,
							and all responses to polls. Now you can ask
							follow-up questions to only students who replied a
							certain way, or ask questions to only certain groups
							of a project.
